A Python Code and it is used to calculate Half-lives of Alpha (AD),Cluster Decay (CD) and Spontaneous Fission (SF)

and to predict Decay Modes of Superheavy Nuclei 

By using this code, the calculations can be done via different models which are the CPPM, VSS, UNIV, Royer formula, UDL, Horoi for AD and CD and Xu, KPS and Soylu models for SF.

It can be used to predict the half-lives of Z>=118 superheavy nuclei isotopes that is very popular topic nowadays.
